# DynaQuant
Open Quantum Systems code for parallel hardware


This is a beta version--there is substantial work remaining to make the code more user-friendly. Warning: the example needs about 150 MB of harddisk space to run. This version of the software is from our publication, Sawaya, N. P. D.; Huh, J.; Takatoshi, F.; Saikin, S. K.; Aspuru-Guzik, A., Nano Letters, 2015, 15 (3), 1722.

Note that in most cases the input files' format should be precisely mimicked (usually no additional comment lines are allowed at the top, for example).
